## Test Emails

Always send test emails before bulk campaigns.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Quick Test">
    **From email editor:**
    1. Click **"Send Test"** button
    2. Enter test email address
    3. Receive email in seconds
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Campaign Test">
    **During bulk send setup:**
    1. Complete campaign configuration
    2. Click **"Send Test"** before final send
    3. Verify everything looks correct
    4. Then send to full audience
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**What to check in tests:**
- Email renders correctly
- Images load properly
- Links work (unsubscribe, CTAs, etc.)
- Personalization/merge tags display correctly
- Mobile vs desktop rendering

---

## Unsubscribe & Compliance

**Automatic compliance:**

<Check>Unsubscribe links added automatically to marketing emails</Check>
<Check>Preference center URLs generated per contact</Check>
<Check>Unsubscribes processed instantly</Check>
<Check>CAN-SPAM and GDPR compliant</Check>

**How it works:**

1. **Unsubscribe link** added to email footer automatically
2. Contact clicks link → taken to preference center
3. Contact unsubscribes → status changed to `unsubscribed` immediately
4. Unsubscribed contacts **cannot** receive marketing emails

**Preference center features:**
- Update email address
- Change name
- Manage subscriptions
- One-click unsubscribe

## Email Templates

Migma uses React Email for template rendering.

**Template features:**
- Mobile-responsive automatically
- Dark mode support
- Cross-client compatible (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, etc.)
- Inline CSS for maximum compatibility

**Using templates:**
1. Create email with Migma AI
2. Save as template (optional)
3. Reuse template for future campaigns
4. Personalize with merge tags
