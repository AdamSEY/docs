## What are Projects?

Projects in Migma help you organize your emails, campaigns, and audiences into separate workspaces. Each project can represent a different brand, client, or campaign initiative.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="One Project Per Brand">
    Create separate projects for each brand you manage. This keeps branding, settings, and audiences isolated.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Names">
    Name projects clearly so team members can easily identify them (e.g., "Acme Corp - Q4 2024" instead of "Project 1").
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Configure Brand Settings First">
    Set up brand colors, fonts, and logos before creating emails to ensure consistency from the start.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Regular Cleanup">
    Archive old projects to keep your workspace organized and improve performance.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
