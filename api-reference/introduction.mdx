## API Structure

The Migma.ai API is organized around REST principles:

- **Predictable resource-oriented URLs**
- **Standard HTTP response codes**
- **JSON request and response bodies**
- **Bearer token authentication**

## Request Format

All `POST`, `PATCH`, and `PUT` requests should use JSON format:

```http
Content-Type: application/json
```

Example request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.migma.ai/v1/projects/import \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"urls": ["https://yourbrand.com"], "name": "My Brand"}'
```

## Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent structure:

### Success Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Response data here
  },
  "metadata": {
    "timestamp": "2024-09-30T12:34:56.789Z",
    "requestId": "req_1234567890"
  }
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error message describing what went wrong",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE",
  "metadata": {
    "timestamp": "2024-09-30T12:34:56.789Z",
    "requestId": "req_1234567890"
  }
}
```

## HTTP Status Codes

The API uses standard HTTP status codes:

| Code | Meaning | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `200` | OK | Request succeeded |
| `201` | Created | Resource was created successfully |
| `400` | Bad Request | Invalid request parameters |
| `401` | Unauthorized | Invalid or missing API key |
| `403` | Forbidden | API key lacks required permissions |
| `404` | Not Found | Resource doesn't exist |
| `429` | Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded |
| `500` | Internal Server Error | Something went wrong on our end |
| `503` | Service Unavailable | Service temporarily unavailable |

## Rate Limiting

API requests are rate limited based on your plan:

| Plan | Rate Limit |
|------|-----------|
| Free | 10 requests/minute |
| Pro | 100 requests/minute |
| Enterprise | Custom limits |

Rate limit information is included in response headers:

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1609459200
```

<Tip>
  When rate limited (429 response), wait for the time specified in `X-RateLimit-Reset` before retrying.
</Tip>

## Pagination

List endpoints support pagination using `limit` and `offset` parameters:

```bash
GET /v1/projects?limit=20&offset=0
```

Response includes pagination metadata:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "projects": [...],
    "total": 45,
    "limit": 20,
    "offset": 0
  }
}
```

## Idempotency

Some endpoints support idempotency to safely retry requests without duplicating operations. Include an `Idempotency-Key` header:

```http
Idempotency-Key: unique-key-12345
```

Requests with the same idempotency key return the same response for 24 hours.

## Webhooks

Instead of polling for status updates, use webhooks to receive real-time notifications:
