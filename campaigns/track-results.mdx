## Understanding Your Metrics

### Open Rate

The percentage of recipients who opened your email.

<Info>
  Due to privacy changes (Apple Mail Privacy Protection), open rates may be inflated. Focus on clicks and conversions for more accurate engagement data.
</Info>

**What affects open rate:**
- Subject line quality
- Sender name recognition
- Send time
- Email list quality
- Previous engagement history

**Improving open rates:**
- Test different subject lines (A/B testing)
- Personalize subject lines with recipient names
- Send at optimal times for your audience
- Clean your email list regularly

### Click Rate

The percentage of recipients who clicked any link in your email.

<Tip>
  Click rate is a more reliable engagement metric than opens, especially post-iOS 15.
</Tip>

**What affects click rate:**
- Email content relevance
- Call-to-action (CTA) clarity
- Link placement
- Email design and layout
- Audience targeting

**Improving click rates:**
- Use clear, action-oriented CTAs
- Place links prominently
- Create compelling content
- Ensure mobile-friendly design
- Segment your audience for relevance

### Bounce Rate

Emails that couldn't be delivered.

<Warning>
  High bounce rates (>5%) can harm your sender reputation and deliverability.
</Warning>

**Types of bounces:**

| Type | Description | Action Required |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Hard Bounce | Permanent delivery failure (invalid email) | Remove from list immediately |
| Soft Bounce | Temporary delivery failure (full inbox) | Retry, remove after 3-5 failures |

**Reducing bounces:**
- Use double opt-in for new subscribers
- Regular list cleaning
- Remove hard bounces immediately
- Monitor soft bounces

### Unsubscribe Rate

Percentage of recipients who unsubscribed.

<Note>
  A healthy unsubscribe rate is 0.1-0.5%. Higher rates may indicate content or frequency issues.
</Note>
