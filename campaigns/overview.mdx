  <Accordion title="Optimize Send Times">
    Schedule your campaigns based on when your audience is most likely to engage. Most industries see higher open rates on Tuesday-Thursday mornings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Segment Your Audience">
    Send targeted campaigns to specific audience segments for better engagement rates. Generic mass emails perform poorly compared to personalized, segmented campaigns.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test Before Sending">
    Always use Email Preflight to check for issues before sending. Test on multiple devices and email clients.
