## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with the End Goal" icon="bullseye">
    Think about what action you want recipients to take. Build your prompt around that goal.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Provide Context" icon="info">
    If this is part of a campaign or series, mention that. AI can maintain consistency better with context.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Be Specific About Structure" icon="sitemap">
    Don't just describe content - describe the layout and sections you envision.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Iterate, Don't Perfect" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Don't try to write the perfect prompt. Generate, review, and refine through conversation.
