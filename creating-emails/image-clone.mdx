## Two Cloning Modes

### Mode 1: Exact Clone

Recreates the image **exactly** as shown, without applying your brand.

**Best for:**
- Analyzing competitor emails
- Converting existing designs without modification
- Template migration from other platforms
- Learning from successful email examples

**Result:** HTML that matches the original image as closely as possible.

---

### Mode 2: Brand-Adapted Clone

Recreates the **structure and layout** but applies your brand colors, fonts, and style.

**Best for:**
- Getting inspiration from competitors
- Adapting templates to your brand
- Converting generic templates
- Maintaining layout while staying on-brand

**Result:** Same structure, your branding.

## What Images Work Best

### Ideal Source Images

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Email Screenshots">
    **Best source for cloning:**
    - Full email screenshots from Gmail, Outlook, etc.
    - Newsletter examples from your inbox
    - Competitor promotional emails
    - Marketing emails from brands you admire

    **Tip:** Take screenshots in desktop email clients for best results
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Design Mockups">
    **Great for conversion:**
    - Figma exports (if you can't use Figma integration)
    - Sketch or Adobe XD designs
    - PDF mockups from designers
    - Canva email templates

    **Tip:** Export at 2x resolution for clarity
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Web Email Archives">
    **Good sources:**
    - ReallyGoodEmails.com screenshots
    - Email gallery sites
    - Pinterest email inspiration boards
    - Email template marketplaces

    **Tip:** Full-length screenshots work better than cropped
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Photos of Screens">
    **Works but not ideal:**
    - Photos of computer screens
    - Mobile phone screenshots
    - Printed email mockups

    **Tip:** Ensure good lighting and avoid glare for OCR accuracy
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Image Quality Guidelines

## Advanced Cloning Techniques

### Combine Image + Text Prompt

Get better results by combining image upload with descriptive text:

```text
[Upload competitor email screenshot]

Recreate this layout but:
- Use our brand colors (purple and gold)
- Replace their product with our AI email tool
- Keep the same 3-column feature section
- Make the hero image full-width instead of contained
- Use our friendly, professional tone
```

### Clone Multiple Sections

Upload images of different email sections and combine them:

```text
[Upload hero section from Email A]
[Upload feature grid from Email B]

Create an email using:
- The hero layout from the first image
- The feature section design from the second image
- Apply my brand styling
- Connect them with smooth transitions
```

### Iterative Refinement

Clone, then refine in steps:

**Initial prompt:**
```text
Clone this email exactly
```

**Refinement 1:**
```text
Now adapt it to my brand colors
```

**Refinement 2:**
```text
Make the CTA buttons larger and more prominent
```

**Refinement 3:**
```text
Add a testimonial section after the features
```

## Tips for Best Results

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Take Full-Length Screenshots" icon="window-maximize">
    Capture the entire email from header to footer in one screenshot. Migma understands full context better than fragments.

    **Pro tip:** Use browser extensions like "Full Page Screen Capture" for long emails
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use High DPI Displays" icon="desktop">
    If possible, take screenshots on retina/HiDPI displays. Higher resolution = better OCR and detail extraction.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clean Backgrounds" icon="brush">
    Screenshot emails against clean backgrounds (white or solid color email clients work best).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Provide Context" icon="comment">
    Tell Migma what to focus on:
    ```text
    Pay special attention to the header layout
    The key element is the three-column feature section
    Make sure to preserve the CTA button style
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Iterate with Feedback" icon="repeat">
    Don't expect perfection on first try. Use chat to refine:
    ```text
    The headline text should be larger
    Move the logo to the left
    Increase spacing between sections
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Text extracted incorrectly" icon="text-slash">

    - Upload higher resolution image
    - Manually correct text in chat refinement
    - Provide the correct text in your prompt
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Colors don't match" icon="palette">

    Update all purple colors to #6D28D9
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Layout structure wrong" icon="table-columns">
    **Cause:** Complex overlapping elements or unusual layouts

    Move the CTA section above the features
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing elements" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    **Cause:** Elements blended into background or cropped

    **Solution:**
