## Remix vs Start from Scratch

| Aspect | Remix | From Scratch |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Starting Point** | Existing email structure | Blank canvas |
| **Speed** | Faster (structure provided) | Slower (design from zero) |
| **Consistency** | Easier to maintain style | Requires more effort |
| **Learning** | Learn from successful emails | More creative freedom |
| **Best For** | Proven layouts, quick variations | Unique designs, experimentation |
| **Brand Application** | ✅ Auto-applied to remixed structure | ✅ Auto-applied to new design |

**Both approaches apply your brand automatically!**

## Advanced Remix Techniques

### Combine Multiple References

**Use multiple emails for inspiration:**

While you can only remix from one email at a time in the UI, you can describe multiple references in your prompt:

```
Use the layout from this remix reference,
but add a product showcase section similar to our last newsletter,
and use the CTA style from our welcome email.
```

### Selective Remixing

**Specify what to keep:**

```
Keep the exact header layout from this remix,
but redesign the body content sections to be more minimal.
Use different imagery but maintain the same image sizes.
```

### Cross-Category Remixing

**Adapt email types:**

```
This is a newsletter remix reference.
Convert it to a product launch email by:
- Replacing news sections with product features
- Changing CTA from "Read More" to "Start Free Trial"
- Adding pricing section before footer
```

## Understanding the Technology

### How Remix Data is Stored

**When you click "Remix":**

1. **Reference data saved** to localStorage:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "email_abc123",
     "subject": "Summer Sale - 50% Off Everything",
     "previewText": "Limited time offer on all products..."
   }
   ```

2. **Redirect to create page** automatically

3. **Create page detects** the pending remix reference

4. **Shows remix chip** at top with subject and link to original

5. **When you generate**, sends `remixReferenceId` to AI backend

6. **AI uses original email** as structural/design reference

### What the AI Sees

**When you remix, the AI receives:**
- Structure and layout of original email
- Design patterns and visual hierarchy
- Section organization
- Image placement approach
- CTA positioning

**AI does NOT copy:**
- Exact text (uses your prompt)
- Brand colors (uses yours)
- Logo (uses yours)
- Fonts (uses yours)

**Result:** Your brand + proven structure = winning combination
