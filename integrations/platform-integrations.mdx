## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Domain Authentication" icon="shield-check">

    Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records for better deliverability.

    All ESPs provide DNS records to add. This prevents spoofing and improves inbox placement.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Start Slow" icon="gauge">
    **Warm up your sending domain:**

    - Day 1: 50 emails
    - Day 2: 100 emails
    - Day 3: 200 emails
    - Gradually increase

    Establishes sender reputation and avoids spam filters.

    **Track key indicators:**

    - **Delivery rate:** Should be greater than 99%
    - **Open rate:** Industry average 15-25%
    - **Click rate:** Industry average 2-5%
    - **Bounce rate:** Should be less than 2%
    - **Complaint rate:** Should be less than 0.1%
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="List Hygiene" icon="broom">
    **Keep lists clean:**

    - Remove hard bounces immediately
    - Remove soft bounces after 3 attempts
    - Honor unsubscribes instantly
